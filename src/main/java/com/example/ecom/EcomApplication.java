/*
 * In simple terms, @SpringBootApplication is a special annotation in Java used in Spring Boot applications to indicate that the class is the starting point of the application. It is like the main entrance door to the entire program.

Let's break it down:

@SpringBootApplication: This annotation is a combination of multiple annotations that Spring Boot provides to configure and bootstrap your application. It includes @Configuration, which marks the class as a source of bean definitions, @EnableAutoConfiguration, which enables automatic configuration of the Spring application based on the classpath, and @ComponentScan, which tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the specified package.

public class EcomApplication: This is the class that contains the main method, making it the starting point of the application. When you run the program, it is this main method that gets executed first.

public static void main(String[] args): The main method is the entry point for the Java program. It is the first method that gets called when you run the application.

SpringApplication.run(EcomApplication.class, args): This line of code starts the Spring Boot application. It tells Spring Boot to take control and start the application. The EcomApplication.class refers to the class that contains the main method (i.e., this class), and args are the command-line arguments that you can pass to the application when running it.

In summary, @SpringBootApplication is a special annotation that sets up and configures your Spring Boot application. The main method serves as the starting point of the program, and when it's run, the Spring Boot application is started, making it ready to handle incoming requests and execute the defined business logic.
